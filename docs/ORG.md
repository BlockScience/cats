### Organizational Value:
CATs empower effective cross-domain collaboration on a 
[**Data Mesh of Data Products**](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html) across business and 
knowledge domains between cross-functional & multi-disciplinary teams and organizations. A Data Mesh solution involves 
Data Products implemented, operated, and maintained by multidisciplinary teams on a self-service Data Mesh platform. 
Data Products service each other as well as end users on this platform. The Data Mesh solution is accomplished by 
federated governance of Data Products and Domains served on a Data Mesh. Individual Data Products and their 
infrastructure are owned and operated by multidisciplinary teams. This is a customer-centric approach to 
overall project implementation life-cycles with nested Data Product life-cycles that have tighter loops (a.k.a. 
Agility).
The advantages of principles and architecture include the following:
    
* **Operational Value:**
    * Reduced operational bottlenecks caused by the communication overheads of cross-team/departmental synchronization 
    * between siloed groups such as cross-disciplinary miscommunication. These overheads are associated with the 
    * coordination of siloed groups constituted of different roles within organizations.
    * Increased service and product agility with the employment of multi-disciplinary teams that operate, maintain, and 
    * potentially own their own infrastructure because there is less infrastructure to own
    * Reduced the operational overhead of data discovery by Content-Addressing the means of processing (input and output 
 data, transformation / process, and infrastructure [as Code (IaC)] and using Content-Addresses as the means of data 
 transport between services.
    * “Improving data quality and resilience of analysis (BI, AI) by bringing producers closer to consumers (removing 
the complexity of intermediate data pipelines)” ([1.](https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/data-domains-data-mesh-gives-business-domains-superpowers/))

* **Business Value:**
    * Enables more control over their data, agility for market reactivity and business scope changes, and data quality increases due to a self-service Data Mesh platform that enables federated governance and increased project visibility ([1.](https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/data-mesh-ultimate-model-for-data-driven-companies/))
    * Enables rational expense estimates of operational and maintenance per data domain ([2.](https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/data-infrastructure-self-service-data-mesh/))
    * Enables Data Services to grow with and adapt to changes to the organization and/or business ([1.](https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/data-domains-data-mesh-gives-business-domains-superpowers/))
