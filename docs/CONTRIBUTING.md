## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the package and to contribute or discuss potential changes before a PR is 
created. Create a new Issue using [templates](https://github.com/BlockScience/cats/issues/new/choose) to guide you 
through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the 
existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

PRs to CATs' package are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next 
release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Include documentation in the repo if applicable.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull"](https://github.com/susam/gitpr) and 
["Scaled Trunk Based Development"](https://docs.dxatscale.io/source-code-management/branching-model#scaled-trunk-based-development)
