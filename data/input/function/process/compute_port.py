"""Function-owned compute port contract for Process [Composed Function] hotFs.

Process ``integrated_subproc`` callables depend on ``ComputePort`` only —
``run_transfer(batch_fn, input_path, ...)``. They must not import Ray or
Plant Job Submission APIs.

Demo batch ABI (adapter concern): ``batch_fn`` is
``Dict[str, np.ndarray] -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]``; the Plant's ComputePort
adapter maps engine batches onto that shape (see docs/storage/INTEROP.md §2g).

The Ray job entrypoint wires Order-submitted ``RayComputePort`` into the
hotF so distributed Ray Data stays behind the Plant adapter.
