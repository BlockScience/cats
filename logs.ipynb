    "\n",
    "Data Contract is a Service agreement between producer and consumer with attribute dependencies for downstream Data Product evolution with dedicated lineage. A data contracts can provide tools for collaboration on data requirements as product promises within a shared context that inform policies for contract mutation along side Data Product versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Data Contract’s Product Promises are what the data product owners expect from its data consumer up to the latest block of information. These promises may include data quality, data usage terms and conditions, schema, service-objectives, billing, etc. Data Contract policy mutation cascaded downstream as bilateral lateral agreements that “forks” lineage as a new Data Product version. For Example, the consumer takes the risk of violating privacy. Data Producers create Data Contracts on Organization and Business Terms. The consumer of the Data Contract enforces Governance policies. The producer of the Data Contract owns the Data Product if the organization doesn't have a Governance body. \n",
    "\n",
    "Governance policies are discussed between data producers and consumers to agree upon data producer requirements. These discussions should culminate into an amenable data structure / dataset. Structured data is conducive for pre-exsisting policies and less discussion. Less structured data will need more discussion and policy feedback loops. We need a Minimal Viable Data Contract that includes what is necessary for an organization to govern with the means of supporting policy feedback loops in a way that guides discussion in a way that balances the prioritization of outcomes and methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interdependent data domains have sub-domains with identifiers for generating Data Products. CAT Nodes will generate and execute Virtual Data Products composed as Data Contracts that enforce Data Provenance using Bills of Materials (BOMs). BOMs are CATs' Content-Addressed Data Provenance record for verifiable data processing and transport on a Mesh network of CAT Nodes. Data Contracts will contain a BOMs lineages and act as block headers for Content-Addressed Transformers (CATs) instances. Data Products are mutated during policy feedback loops informed collaborators communicating their understanding of knowledge domains. Collaborators will identify knowledge sub-domains with references and will access sub-domains using Content-Addresses. Access is federated via knowledge domain hierarchies in abstractions that enable collaborators to participate in governance cycles by leveraging their understanding of knowledge."
