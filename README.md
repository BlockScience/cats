# CATs: Content-Addressable Transformers

## Description:

**Content-Addressable Transformers (CATs)** is an edge-computing [XaaS](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/xaas) framework that establishs a **[Data Mesh](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/#what-is-data-mesh)** as a *self-service* Platform for *intra/inter-orginizational Data Service Collaboration* with *verifiable* **Data Provenance**. **CAT Nodes** are edge/mesh-peer implimentations of **[Data Products](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/#data-product)** intended to be system *integration points* that enable collaboration on the *verification, retrieval, and re-execution* of **interoperable** and scalable computing / data processing workloads and their components *intra/inter-orginizationally* via *content-addressing* their **[Bills-Of-Materials (BOMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials)** as a means of Data Provenance. CAT Node's output BOMs to provide access to a domain's analytical data as a product and to **verify** the means of processing as code (input, compute/process/transformation, output, & infrastructure) beteen CAT Nodes. BOMs are used as *supply-chains of evidence* that certify the accuracy of services offered by *Data Products* by enabling the maintenance and reporting of [data and process lineage & provenance](https://bi-insider.com/posts/data-lineage-and-data-provenance/).   

*CAT Nodes* heterogenious scales compute / data processing workload portability between client-server cloud platforms and mesh (p2p) networks with minimal rework or modification. *CAT Node's* enable this via their execution of horizontal & vertical scallable **CATs** or *content-addressed data processing (/ transformation)* **workloads**. CATs are inputed & outputted as **BOMs** acting as *Data Provenance records* which are used to establishe a Data Mesh. The Data Mesh is established using BOMs because the edge protocol mechanism used for the [Content-Addressed Storage (CAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) of CATs as BOMs is also the means of Data Transport that networks CAT Nodes as verifiable lineages of Data Provenance (* **[Details](docs/LineageOfProvenance.md)**). This enables the Mesh to grow naturally / heterogeneously scale when organizations communicate with BOMs as a means of cross-collaboration on *Data Products* within the feedback loops of their **Data Initiatives.**

## Computational Governance:

### The *Control-Feedback Loop* of CAT Nodes' *Architectural Quantum*:

CATs Chaordic Kernel
*CAT Node's* **[Architectural Quantum (AQ)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html#LogicalArchitecturedataProductTheArchitecturalQuantum)** is a *[Minimal* **Federated Operating Model (FOM)](https://www.starburst.io/blog/data-mesh-book-bulletin-principle-of-federated-computational-governance/)** as the re-executable and exchangable *atomic unit* representating the architectural domain of Data Product contriburion. The AQ is content-addressed within a BOM containing the AQ's components such that organizations can collaborate on a Data Mesh with verifiable provenance of *interoperable AQ compoents*. CAT Node's runtime realization of the *minimal FOM / Quantum Architecture* is the **Ordering** of **Execution** is **Invoiced** into a **Bill-Of-Materials** as the following **Control-Feedback Loop**:

- **Detailed** *Loop* [here](./docs/ControlFeedbackLoop.md)
- **Summarized** *Loop* below:
  - **A: Manifactured Execution** - CATs (*CAT workloads*) are **Ordered** and **Invoiced** for verification and registered as **[BOMs](docs/BOM.md)** to serve as **Data Provenance records** that uniquely identify CATs and their content for **verifiable data processing** using content-addresses. CATs are deployable as parallelized and distributed processes to support scalable data processing microservices.
    - **1.** the *Node's* **Factory** 
      - **a.** *consumes* & *processes* a content-addressed **Order**
      - **b.** *composes* and *produces* an *ephemeral* **Executor** of CATs using *AQ components* within **Order**
    - **2.** the *Node's* **Executor** 
      - **a.** *executes* the *AQ components* as **Function [FaaS]** on **Structure [PaaS]**
      - **b.** **Invoices** the *execution of data prcessing* as staged output **Content-Addresses**
  - **B: Content-Addressed Bills-of-Materials (BOMs)** - *BOMs* employ Node **CAS-over-HTTP** for [Data Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_verification) and **content-address retrieval over HTTP URI** (`*_uri` locators; equality as `ni:`). That uniquely identifies CAT content and retrieves it without IPFS CIDs on the live path. CATs' use of this content-addressing mechanism establishes a self-service Data Mesh as a heterogeneously scalable Compute Platform deployable on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as CAT Node's execution paradigm (Structure [PaaS]).
    - **3.** the *Node's* **Runtime** *emits* a **BOM** as the *Mesh-transportable Data Provenance record* to be *shared* & *re-executed* between Node; a Node-local **BOM registry** indexes verified envelopes so the next Order can be discovered via `content_id` / `data_uri` / `bom_ldp_uri` (not only out-of-band `order_uri`) — see [BomRegistry.md](./docs/BomRegistry.md) / [ControlFeedbackLoop.md](./docs/ControlFeedbackLoop.md)

### The sustainment of *Data Initiatives* & *Product Collaboration* on a Data Mesh's Architectural Planes via CATs' *Architectural Quantum*:

CATs BOM Activity
A *Data Product's **Domain*** is the [Domain-Driven Design's (DDDs) bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html#DataAndDistributedDomainDrivenArchitectureConvergence) whose cross-functional team owns one or more **architectural quanta**. [Data Products](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html#LogicalArchitecturedataProductTheArchitecturalQuantum) provide access to that context’s analytical data's [Domain](docs/DESIGN.md#example-data-product-design-domains-on-a-cat-node-mesh) — each quantum bundling the code, data/metadata, and infrastructure needed to serve it autonomously, with processing as internal implementations rather than the ownership boundary. Data Product collaborators of participating organizations will employ CATs for rapid policy refinement to manage systems within control-feedback loops of **[Data Initiatives](https://github.com/DynamicalSystemsGroup/cats?tab=readme-ov-file#continuous-data-initiative)**. CATs' **Architectural Quantum (AQ)** is a [Minimal Federated Operating Model](https://www.starburst.io/blog/data-mesh-book-bulletin-principle-of-federated-computational-governance/) employed by CATs' **Architectural Planes** as a *DDD* principle described in **[Data Mesh of Data Products](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)** to *reify Data Initiatives* (**[Design Description](docs/DESIGN.md)**).

- CATs' **Action Plane** is the *Data Product Management interface* that orchestrates and supervises how virtual resources owned by *Data Product(s)* should be *managed, routed, and processed* in alignment with *Data Initiatives* and is stored “offmesh” (“offline”). CAT Node's realize the AQ's *Control-Feedback Loop* on the Action Plane which supervises the exchange of data between CAT sub-components on the *Data Plane* in adherence to Data Contracting Standards of **Service-Level Aggreements (SLA)** between participating organizations on the Data Mesh.
  - **Inter-Product Collaboration:** Multi-disciplinary and cross-functional *Data Stewardship teams* manange Data Products Inter-Orginizationally on the Action Plane via the registration and cataloging of **BOMs** by *Data Product teams*. The Action Plane establishes and sustains *Data Initiatives* because content-addressing BOMs for **Data Provenance** makes CATs *reteivable, shareable, composable, re-executable, and iteroperable* amongst independent teams such that they support *Intra/Inter-Orginizational Collaboration* on **Data Products**. *Data Initiatives* will be naturally established as a result of cross-collaboration on CAT Node's *Data Products* by communicating BOMs that produce CATs.
- CATs' **Data Plane** is the *Analytical Data Processing interface* that *orders, executes, invoices, and transports* content-addressed **CATs** between CAT Nodes as mesh-shareable **BOMs** to be stored “onmesh” (“online”) in alignment with *Data Initiatives* and in adherence to Data Contracting Standards of **Operational-Level Agreements (OLA)** between participating organizations on the Data Mesh.
  - **Intra-Product Collaboration:** Multi-disciplinary and cross-functional *Data Product teams* impliment CAT Nodes to produce interconnected *Data Services of CATs between Products* on a Data Mesh by *operating, contributing, and maintaining* different portions of the entire cloud-service model (XaaS) in adherence to CATs' *Architectural Quantum*. Teams can submit contributions as CAT **Orders** based on Subject-Mater Expertise and/or their roles using CATs’ *Order API*. 
    - CAT's **Order API** is used to generate an *Order* of CATs and is a part of BOM's Data Model for which can be utilized for a variety of Use-Cases.

## Get Started!:

#### 0. Clone & Install CAT Node:

a. Clone and `cd` into CATs:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DynamicalSystemsGroup/cats.git
cd cats
```

b. Installs uv & pinned Python version, and creates .venv installs with locked dependencies from uv.lock:

```bash
make deps-uv-sync
```

- See [DEPS — uv](./docs/DEPS.md#uv) for the manual steps behind `make deps-uv-sync`.
- See [ENV.md](./docs/ENV.md) for the full environment workflow, including the `ops` and `mac` extras.

#### 1. Installation:

`make deps-all` - Runs on macOS or Linux (see the [Makefile](./Makefile) and `make help`), or follow [DEPS.md](./docs/DEPS.md) to install each dependency manually.

#### 2. [Storage](./docs/STORAGE.md) — content-store (CAS + optional Kubo):

Live Orders use Node **CAS-over-HTTP**. Host Kubo is **optional** operator tooling (not required for live Orders).
If you still want Kubo locally:

```bash
make content-store-init
```

Does **not** start Kubo — that is `content-store-ensure` / `node-up`. Details: [STORAGE.md](./docs/STORAGE.md) / [IPFS.md](./docs/IPFS.md).

#### 3. [Node Lifecycle](./docs/NodeLifeCycle.md) — start / status / stop:

```bash
make node-start  # soft-probes ContentStore; Kubo not required for CAS-only
# or: make node-up     # content-store-ensure && node-start (brings optional Kubo up too)
make node-status # flask=up|down + content_store=ready|not_ready
make node-stop   # Flask only — leave Kubo running if you started it
```

*Optional:* `make node-down` = `make node-stop` + `make content-store-shutdown`
Full command reference: [NodeLifeCycle.md](./docs/NodeLifeCycle.md).

#### 4. [Demonstration](./docs/DEMO.md):

CAT Node is shipped with *Techncal Use-Case CAT Workload Specifications ( Templates / "Recipies")* as *CAT **Orders*** for which proccess will be executed and **Invoiced**. This repository will feature a Scalable Scientific Computing application **Ordered** as a 2 CATs. This **Order** is specified to utilize [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) as an execution middleware framework **Plant (SaaS)** deployed on **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** for interoperable & parallelized distributed computing applications / Big Data processing with Scientific Computing enabled [ecosystem integrations](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/ray-libraries.html) such as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

#### 5. [Testing:](./docs/TEST.md) *CAT Node Integration & Unit Tests*

#### 6. [Dashboards](./docs/DASHBOARDS.md)

#### 7. Auto-Diagramming Software Archtecture:

## Key Concepts:

- **[Data Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_verification)** - a process for which data is checked for 
accuracy and inconsistencies before processed
- **[Data Provenance](https://bi-insider.com/posts/data-lineage-and-data-provenance/)** - a means of proving data 
lineage using historical records that provide the means 
of pipeline re-execution and **[data validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation)**
- **[Data Lineage](https://bi-insider.com/posts/data-lineage-and-data-provenance/)** - reporting of data lifecyle from 
source to destination
- **[Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials)** - an extensive list of raw materials,
components, and instructions required to construct, manufacture, or repair a product or service
- **[Content-Addressing](docs/CAS.md)** - reffers to **Content-Addressed Storage (CAS)**: uniquely identify by content (`ni:`) and retrieve over HTTP URI (`*_uri` / Node CAS-over-HTTP), rather than by a location-only address or an IPFS CID.
- **[Distributed Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)** - typically the concurrent and/or 
parallel execution of job tasks distributed to networked computers processing data
