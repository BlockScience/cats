# CATs: Content-Addressable Transformers ([Pre-Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha))

### Description:
CATs is a unified distributed processing framework and web application back-end orchestrated with 
**[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** to be deployed on a peer-to-peer mesh network client acting as a 
cluster head node. CATs enable the creation of Web3 data products as a decentralized service with data process 
verification using existing Web2 centralized cloud service technologies (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) in AWS, GCP, Azure, etc., 
without the need of a smart-contract language. CATs nurture collaboration across domains between cross-functional / 
multi-disciplinary teams and organizations on products by [**Content-Addressing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) 
the means of processing (input, transformation / process, output, infrastructure [as Code (IaC)]) and using 
Content-Addresses as the means of data transport between services.

### Why CATs are useful:
* **Execution:**
  * CATs execute Distributed Processes which are distributed as tasks for Concurrent and/or Parallelized execution on Web2 
    infrastructure
* **Data Verification:**
  * Content-Addresses can be used to verify data processing (input, transformation / process, output, infrastructure)
    * Enables data process re-execution via retrieval of said means using IPFS CIDs as Content-Addresses
* **Data (& Process) Lineage & Provenance:**
  * Certifies the accuracy of data processing on data products and pipelines by enabling maintenance & reporting of data 
  and process lineage & provenance as chains of evidence
* **Collaboration:**
  * Cross-functional teams & organization for collaboration across domains on verifiable data processes via a UI that 
  accepts Data Provenance record entry as Input that is also CAT Output
  
### Content-Addressing Data Processing with [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/):
* IPFS **[CIDs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/)** (Content Identifiers) are used as content addresses 
that provide the means of verifying data transformation accuracy.
* IPFS **[client](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/#official-distributions)** is used to identify and retrieve 
inputs, transformations, and outputs for verifying transformation accuracy given CIDs

### CAT Concepts:
CATs (Data) Pipeline inputs (I/O Data & Transformations) produce a sequence of Bill of Content Addressed Materials 
(catBOM) that enable Data Provenance and cross-organization participation on (big) data processing using Distributed 
(Data) Processing frameworks
* **Fundamental:**
  * **[Content-Addressable Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage)** - a way to store 
  information such that it can be retrieved based on its content rather than its location
  * **[Data Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_verification)** - a process for which data is checked for 
  accuracy and inconsistencies before processed
  * **[Data (& Process) Lineage & Provenance](https://bi-insider.com/posts/data-lineage-and-data-provenance/)** 
    * **Data Lineage** - reporting of data lifecyle from source to destination
    * **Data Provenance** - a means of proving data lineage using historical records that provide the means of pipeline 
    re-execution and **[data validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation)**
  * **[Distributed Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)** - typically the concurrent and/or 
  parallel execution of job tasks distributed to networked computers processing data
  * **[Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials)** - an extensive list of raw materials,
  components, and instructions required to construct, manufacture, or repair a product or service
  

### CATs Data Provenance as CAT I/O: catBOM as Provenance Record
* **catBOM** - a collection of CIDs & URIs metadata for establishing provenance that enable (re-)execution of CAT 
processes
    * catBOM values are modifiable I/O for CATs
      * CIDs are used to retrieve CAT Input off IPFS and transfer them between CATs & on separate on CATclusters
      * URIs identify CATclustersâ€™ Distributed File System (FS) used as Distributed DataFrame transformation cache 
      of a Content Addressed Dataset (CAD)
      * Current & Input BOM CIDs & BOM I/O URIs
    * **Illustration of catBOM as I/O surface of CAT**
    ![alt_text](images/BOM_only_with_io_surfaces.jpeg?raw=true)
      * **catBOM Contents:**
        * **Invoice / Content-Addressed Dataset (CAD)** - a **data format** Content-Addressed Data generated by IPFS 
        CIDing events as a collection IPFS CIDs of Dataset Partitions and partition URIs. Partitions are generated by 
        CAT DataFrame Partition Shuffling across Worker Nodes of CATclusters
          * **Content-Addressed Input (CAI)** URI & CIDs - an input dataset for a CAT that has been content-addressed
          as an Invoice/CAD
          * **Content-Addressed Output (CAO)** URI & CIDs - an output dataset of a CAT that has been content-addressed
          as an Invoice/CAD
          * Invoice URI (contains CADs as CAT I/O)
        * **Transformer URI & CID** (CAT Object Configuration & CAT input)
          * Transformer URIs (of DataFrame Transformation cache)
* **BOMchain** - Linked List of catBOMs used to create & execute **CATpipes** (Data Pipelines of CATs)
  * BOMchain is modifiable I/O for CATpipe
    * Can be used for data pipeline verification
  * **Illustration of BOMchain as I/O surface of CATpipe**

### Next Steps:
1. Replace s3 with IPFS Cluster and Filebase for Content-Addressable Storage in order to remove ipfs client from cluster workers
   1. Alternative: for IPFS server bug (`ipfs init --profile server`) - loop IPFS initialization until provided a public 
   IP Address
2. Implement CATnode MVP to remove the need for users to install dependencies:

    A.Options:
      * CATsVM Disk Image (Ubuntu)
      * CATsContainer

    B. Add dependencies to Terraform one CATnode exists
3. Unit Test: BOM CID equivalence
4. Distributed debugger for Plant(s) \[SaaS(s)\]
5. Unit & Integration Tests
6. Produce new SaaS Plants with CAT Factory
7. CI/CD
8. Provenance catBOM
9. Options to Content-Address Everything

### Long-Term Vision:
  * CATs software is intended to be deployed on a peer-to-peer (p2p) mesh network client that enable products 
  implemented with the entire Cloud Service Model to be Decentralized Cloud Services by Content-Addressing the entire 
  service.
  * **[IPFS Compute](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/abhiyerra/ipfs-compute)** will be used to as a 
  [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM) module task server, broadcaster, & executor leveraging 
  [IPFS Lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite) on cluster nodes for distributed processing
